# BlueManScroll

A 2D side-scrolling platformer that integrates educational elements through algebra-based power-up activation mechanics.

Built using the **Solar2D** (formerly Corona SDK) engine and Lua, this project demonstrates cross-platform mobile game development with engaging gameplay twists. Players control the "Blue Man" character, navigating levels while solving quick algebraic equations to unlock and activate power-ups.

## Key Features

- Classic side-scrolling platformer mechanics (jumping, running, obstacle avoidance)
- Innovative power-up system requiring solutions to algebraic problems for activation
- In-app purchase integration via IAP Badger library
- Lightweight architecture suitable for mobile devices
- Educational gameplay fusion: mathematics embedded in core progression

## Tech Stack

- **Engine**: Solar2D (Lua-based cross-platform game engine)
- **Language**: Lua
- **Monetization**: IAP Badger (unified in-app purchases for iOS, Android, and Amazon)
- **Platforms**: Targeted for mobile (iOS and Android builds supported via Solar2D)

## Project Status

This repository contains a prototype/work-in-progress implementation. It serves as a demonstration of creative gameplay design combining entertainment with STEM education.

## Setup & Development

1. Install [Solar2D](https://solar2d.com/).
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rememberit1/BlueManScroll.git
   3. Open the project folder in the Solar2D Simulator.
4. Run and test directly in the simulator for rapid iteration.
